# Try-Error Codebase Analysis: Bugs, Inefficiencies, and Missing Features

## 1. src/types.ts

### Bugs

- [x] **Type Guard Vulnerability**: The `isTryError` function checks for symbol branding but doesn't validate that the symbol value is exactly `true`. An attacker could create an object with `[TRY_ERROR_BRAND]: "truthy"` and it would pass.
- [x] **Missing Type Validation**: The type guard doesn't validate that `context` is actually a Record<string, unknown> when present.

### Inefficiencies

- [x] **Redundant Type Guards**: Having both `isTrySuccess` and `isTryFailure` that just negate `isTryError` is redundant. One would suffice.
- [x] **Symbol Lookup**: Using `Symbol.for()` instead of a private Symbol means unnecessary global symbol registry lookup.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Error Serialization**: TryError can't be safely serialized to JSON due to the Symbol property.
- [x] **No Error Comparison**: No way to compare if two TryErrors are equivalent.
- [x] **No Error Cloning**: No utility to create a copy of a TryError with modifications.

## 2. src/errors.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Cache Invalidation Issue**: The config cache uses a version number stored on the function object `(getConfig as any).version`, which is fragile and could be accidentally overwritten.
- [x] **Stack Parsing Brittleness**: The stack parsers use regex that may fail on minified code or non-standard stack formats.
- [x] **Environment Detection Cache**: `cachedEnvironment` is never invalidated, so if code runs in multiple environments (e.g., SSR), it will use the wrong environment.
- [x] **Test Environment Issue**: The `isProduction()` function has special handling for test environments but doesn't reset the cache between tests.

### Inefficiencies

- [x] **Repeated Config Access**: `getCachedConfig()` is called multiple times in `createError` even when config won't change during execution.
- [x] **String Concatenation**: Building error messages and stack traces using string concatenation instead of template literals in some places.
- [x] **Multiple Environment Checks**: `detectEnvironment()` and `detectRuntime()` do similar work but don't share logic.

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Async Stack Traces**: No support for async stack traces in Node.js.
- [x] **No Error Deduplication**: Creating the same error multiple times creates new objects each time.
- [ ] **No Custom Stack Trace Formatting**: Can't customize how stack traces are formatted beyond basic options.
- [ ] **No Error Metrics**: No built-in way to track error creation performance or frequency.

## 3. src/config.ts

### Bugs

- [x] **ConfigPresets Not Immutable**: Preset functions return new objects each time but the `ConfigPresets` object itself is mutable.
- [ ] **Memory Leak Risk**: The `Performance.measureErrorCreation` creates promises in a loop but doesn't await them, potentially causing memory issues.
- [ ] **Unsafe Type Assertion**: `configure()` uses type assertion when calling preset functions without validation.

### Inefficiencies

- [x] **Preset Recreation**: Every call to a preset function creates a new configuration object instead of caching.
- [x] **Deep Merging**: Configuration merging doesn't handle nested objects properly (shallow merge only).
- [ ] **Performance Measurement**: The performance utilities use `Date.now()` as fallback which has poor precision.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Config Validation**: No schema validation for configuration objects.
- [ ] **No Config Migration**: No way to migrate from old config formats to new ones.
- [ ] **No Environment Variables**: No built-in support for configuring via environment variables.
- [x] **No Config Composition**: Can't easily compose multiple configurations together.

## 4. src/sync.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **tryCall Type Overloads**: The function overloads for `tryCall` don't properly handle all cases, especially when options are passed.
- [x] **Error Message Loss**: When creating errors in `trySync`, the original error's stack trace is lost.

### Inefficiencies

- [x] **Repeated Error Creation**: Each try\* function creates errors independently instead of sharing logic.
- [ ] **Type Checking**: The `isOptionsObject` check in `tryCall` is verbose and could be simplified.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Retry Logic**: Synchronous operations don't have built-in retry support.
- [x] **No Circuit Breaker**: No way to stop trying operations that consistently fail.
- [x] **No Error Recovery**: No built-in patterns for error recovery in sync operations.

## 5. src/async.ts

### Bugs

- [x] **Promise Race Memory Leak**: In `tryAsync` with timeout, the original promise continues running even after timeout.
- [x] **Timeout Promise Not Cleaned**: The timeout setTimeout is never cleared if the operation completes before timeout.
- [ ] **Retry Delay Issue**: In the `retry` function, the delay calculation could overflow for large attempt numbers.

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Promise Creation**: Many functions create intermediate promises that could be avoided.
- [ ] **Redundant Error Wrapping**: Errors are wrapped multiple times as they pass through different functions.
- [ ] **No Debouncing**: No built-in debouncing for async operations that might be called rapidly.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Progress Tracking**: No way to track progress of long-running async operations.
- [ ] **No Cancellation**: No built-in cancellation support for async operations.
- [x] **No Rate Limiting**: No built-in rate limiting for async operations.
- [x] **No Queue Management**: No way to queue and manage multiple async operations.

## 6. src/factories.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Type Safety Issue**: The factory functions use type assertions (`as E`) which could hide type errors.
- [x] **Missing Validation**: No validation that required fields are actually provided when creating domain errors.

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Duplicate Factory Functions**: Many factory functions do similar things with slight variations.
- [x] **No Factory Caching**: Creating the same error type repeatedly recreates the entire error object.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Factory Registry**: No central registry of error factories for discovery.
- [x] **No Factory Composition**: Can't compose factories from other factories.
- [x] **No Automatic Serialization**: Domain-specific errors don't automatically serialize their extra fields.
- [ ] **No Factory Validation**: No way to validate that a factory is being used correctly.

## 7. src/utils.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Stack Trace Check**: `createEnhancedError` checks `process.env.NODE_ENV` which may not exist in all environments.
- [ ] **Type Assertion Issues**: Several functions use unsafe type assertions without proper validation.

### Inefficiencies

- [x] **Array Operations**: Functions like `filterSuccess` and `filterErrors` iterate through arrays multiple times.
- [x] **String Building**: `formatErrorForLogging` builds strings inefficiently with array joins.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Error Diffing**: Can't compare what changed between two errors.
- [x] **No Error Grouping**: No way to group similar errors together.
- [x] **No Error Sampling**: No built-in sampling for high-frequency errors.
- [x] **No Error Correlation**: No way to correlate related errors across operations.

## 8. src/setup.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Environment Detection**: `autoSetup` uses incomplete heuristics for environment detection that could fail.
- [ ] **React Detection**: The `setupReact` function's localhost detection logic is inverted (`!window.location.hostname.includes("localhost") === false`).
- [x] **Next.js Detection**: Relies on private Next.js internals (`__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT`) which could break.

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Repeated Configuration**: Each setup function repeats similar configuration logic.
- [ ] **No Setup Caching**: Multiple calls to setup functions recreate configurations.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Setup Validation**: No way to validate that setup was successful.
- [x] **No Setup Composition**: Can't compose multiple setup configurations.
- [x] **No Dynamic Setup**: No way to change setup based on runtime conditions.
- [x] **No Setup Teardown**: No way to cleanly tear down a setup.

## 9. src/index.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Re-export Naming Conflicts**: Re-exporting `tryMap` as both `trySyncMap` and `tryAsyncMap` could cause confusion.

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Exporting everything from all modules prevents effective tree-shaking.
- [ ] **Circular Dependencies**: Potential for circular dependencies with the current export structure.

### Missing Features

- [x] **No Version Export**: No way to check the library version at runtime.
- [x] **No Feature Detection**: No way to check which features are available.
- [ ] **No Lazy Loading**: No support for lazy loading parts of the library.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. [ ] **No Object Pooling**: Despite being mentioned in config, object pooling is not implemented.
2. [ ] **No Lazy Evaluation**: Error properties are always computed even if never accessed.
3. [ ] **No Memoization**: Repeated operations aren't memoized.

### Type Safety Issues

1. [ ] **Excessive Type Assertions**: Too many `as` casts throughout the codebase.
2. [ ] **Any Types**: Several uses of `any` type that could be made more specific.
3. [ ] **Missing Generics**: Some functions could benefit from better generic constraints.

### Documentation Issues

1. [ ] **Incomplete Examples**: Many functions have basic examples but don't show edge cases.

### Security Concerns

1. [ ] **No Sanitization**: Error messages and context aren't sanitized.
2. [ ] **No PII Detection**: No automatic detection of personally identifiable information in errors.
3. [ ] **No Rate Limiting**: No built-in rate limiting for error creation (note: rate limiting exists for async operations but not for error creation itself).

## New Issues Found During Implementation

### Additional Performance Concerns

1. [ ] **Config Version Tracking**: The version tracking mechanism using `(getConfig as any).version` is fragile and could be improved.
2. [ ] **Promise.allSettled in tryAnyAsync**: Could be optimized for cases where we want to stop on first success.
3. [ ] **Preset Cache Map**: The preset cache grows unbounded, could use LRU cache.

### Additional Type Safety Issues
