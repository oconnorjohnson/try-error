# RAG-Optimized Documentation for try-error

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive plan for generating LLM-optimized documentation that goes far beyond typical user-facing docs. This documentation is specifically designed for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems to answer detailed technical questions about the try-error codebase.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Comprehensive Documentation Plan** (`llm/rag-documentation-plan.md`)

- Detailed structure for documenting every aspect of the codebase
- Six major documentation categories covering:
  - Core functionality deep dives
  - Complete API reference with implementation details
  - System architecture documentation
  - Integration patterns
  - Performance analysis
  - Common patterns catalog

### 2. **Example Deep-Dive Documentation** (`llm/rag-docs/create-error-deep-dive.md`)

- Shows exactly what the RAG-optimized documentation looks like
- Includes:
  - Performance characteristics (nanosecond-level timing)
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Internal dependencies and call graphs
  - Runtime context injection examples
  - Edge cases and gotchas
  - Platform-specific behavior

### 3. **Automated Documentation Generator** (`llm/scripts/generate-rag-docs.ts`)

- TypeScript tool using the TypeScript compiler API
- Automatically extracts:
  - Function signatures and parameters
  - JSDoc comments
  - Usage examples from tests
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Internal dependencies

## Key Features of RAG Documentation

### 1. **Runtime Context Injection Documentation**

The documentation extensively covers how to inject context at runtime:

- Direct injection via `createError({ context: { userId: req.user.id } })`
- Middleware-based enrichment
- Context wrapping utilities
- Lazy evaluation patterns

### 2. **Implementation Details**

Unlike user docs, RAG docs include:

- Exact algorithm flows with timing data
- Memory allocation patterns
- Internal function dependencies
- Performance cliffs to avoid

### 3. **Real-World Patterns**

- Request context patterns
- Lazy context evaluation
- Context inheritance
- Error factory patterns

### 4. **Metadata-Rich Format**

Each document includes:

```yaml
id: unique-identifier
tags: [searchable, tags, for, retrieval]
module: core|react|middleware
complexity: basic|intermediate|advanced
performance_impact: negligible|low|medium|high
```

## How This Helps RAG Systems

1. **Semantic Search**: Tags and metadata enable better retrieval
2. **Context-Aware**: Each chunk includes enough context to stand alone
3. **Example-Rich**: Multiple examples from docs, tests, and real usage
4. **Performance Data**: Actual benchmarks help answer performance questions
5. **Cross-References**: Related functions and concepts are linked

## Next Steps

1. **Run the generator**: `ts-node llm/scripts/generate-rag-docs.ts`
2. **Index the content**: Feed generated docs into your RAG system
3. **Test queries**: Verify the system can answer complex technical questions
4. **Iterate**: Add more specialized documentation as needed

## Example Queries This Enables

- "How do I inject runtime context into errors in try-error?"
- "What's the performance impact of large context objects?"
- "How does error pooling work internally?"
- "What are the best practices for context in high-throughput scenarios?"
- "How do I implement request-scoped error context?"

The documentation is specifically optimized to answer these types of detailed technical questions that go beyond what typical user documentation covers.
