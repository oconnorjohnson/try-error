# Try-Error Development Memory

## Project Overview

Try-Error is a TypeScript error handling library designed for zero-overhead, type-safe error handling. It provides a functional approach to error handling without exceptions, similar to Go's error handling pattern but with better ergonomics for TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Key Decisions & Progress

### Core Library

- Implemented zero-overhead error handling with discriminated unions
- Created comprehensive error types and factories
- Added source location tracking for better debugging
- Achieved performance targets (< 0.1ms overhead)

### React Package Progress (Latest)

#### Remaining High-Priority Items ðŸš§

1. **Error Recovery Strategies**: Need patterns beyond simple retry
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Add support for optimistic UI updates
3. **Framework Support**: Next.js, Remix, React Native, SSR
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
5. **Development Experience**: Better error messages, examples, devtools

## Technical Context

### Performance Considerations

- React hooks use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for memoization
- State updates are batched where possible
- AbortController cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Execution ID pattern prevents race conditions

### Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive unit tests for all hooks and components
- Manual event dispatching for async error boundary tests (jsdom limitation)
- Mock providers for telemetry testing
- Act warnings addressed with proper async handling

### API Design Principles

1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box, configuration is optional
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work immediately, advanced features opt-in
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions
4. **Framework Agnostic**: Core library has no dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Implement error recovery strategies (retry with backoff, circuit breaker)
2. Add optimistic update support to mutation hooks
3. Create framework-specific integrations
4. Improve accessibility features
5. Build development tools and better documentation

## Optimization and Extensibility Implementation

We've successfully implemented major performance optimizations and extensibility features:

### Performance Optimizations Completed:

1. **Object Pooling** (`src/pool.ts`):

   - ErrorPool class with pre-allocation and reuse
   - Global pool management with statistics
   - Configurable pool size and enable/disable
   - Integrated into createError with config flag

2. **Lazy Evaluation** (`src/lazy.ts`):
   - createLazyError for on-demand property computation
   - Lazy getters for expensive operations (stack traces, source location)
   - Debug proxy for monitoring property access
   - Integrated into createError with lazyStackTrace config

### Extensibility Features Completed:

1. **Middleware System** (`src/middleware.ts`):

   - MiddlewarePipeline for composing error handlers
   - Common middleware: logging, retry, transform, circuit breaker, rate limiting
   - Global middleware registry
   - Composable and filterable middleware

2. **Plugin System** (`src/plugins.ts`):
   - Complete plugin architecture with lifecycle hooks
   - Plugin dependencies and ordering
   - Capability system: config, middleware, error types, utilities
   - Example Sentry plugin implementation
   - Global plugin manager

### Key Design Decisions:

- Object pooling uses mutable error objects internally but presents immutable interface
- Lazy evaluation uses Object.defineProperty for transparent property access
- Middleware follows Express-style next() pattern
- Plugins can extend all aspects of try-error without modifying core

### Integration Points:

- Performance features controlled via config.performance options
- Middleware can be applied globally or per-operation
- Plugins integrate seamlessly with existing error flow
- All features are tree-shakeable when not used

These implementations significantly enhance try-error's performance in high-throughput scenarios and make it extensible for any use case.

### Summary of Completed High-Priority Improvements

1. **Async Error Boundary** - Critical for modern React apps âœ…
2. **Type Predicates Enhancement** - Improved type safety âœ…
3. **Telemetry Integration** - Essential for production monitoring âœ…
4. **Performance and Bug Fixes** - Fixed race conditions and memory leaks âœ…
5. **Optimistic Updates** - Enhanced user experience for mutations âœ…
6. **Error Recovery Strategies** - Robust error handling patterns âœ…

### Remaining High-Priority Work

1. **Framework Support** - Next.js, Remix, React Native specific utilities
2. **Accessibility** - Ensure error states are properly announced to screen readers
3. **Better development experience** - DevTools integration and debugging utilities

The React package has been significantly enhanced with production-ready error handling capabilities, including async error boundaries, telemetry integration, optimistic updates, and sophisticated error recovery strategies. The implementation follows React best practices and provides a comprehensive solution for error handling in modern React applications.

## Fixed Issues

### Documentation TypeScript Errors (2024-01-XX)

- Fixed TypeScript error in try-error-docs/src/app/docs/guides/plugins/page.tsx
- Issue: Template literal with `${value}` inside JSX code block was causing parser errors
- Solution: Escaped the template literal properly by using `\`Processed: \${value}\`` instead of `` `Processed: ${value}` ``
- This ensures the template literal is treated as a string within the JSX context rather than being interpreted as JSX expression syntax

### Removed Misleading Performance Claims (2024-01-XX)

- Removed all references to "1700% overhead" from documentation
- This was the result of a flawed benchmark edge case and not representative of real-world performance
- Updated all performance claims to reflect realistic overhead:
  - Success path: <3% overhead (unchanged)
  - Error path: 20-120% overhead depending on configuration
  - Default config: ~100-120% overhead (with full debugging features)
  - Production config: ~40% overhead (no stack traces)
  - Minimal config: ~20% overhead (bare essentials)
- Updated specific overhead breakdowns:
  - Stack trace capture: ~80% overhead (was 1200%)
  - Context deep cloning: ~30% overhead (was 300%)
  - Source location parsing: ~10% overhead (was 200%)
  - Timestamp generation: ~5% overhead (was 50%)
- These numbers better reflect real-world performance characteristics

# try-error Development Memory

## 2025-06-26 - Playground Feature Removed

### Context

The interactive playground feature was removed from the documentation as it was deemed unnecessary.

### What was removed:

1. **Components**:
   - `/src/components/Playground.tsx`
   - `/src/components/PlaygroundAdvanced.tsx`
   - `/src/components/SandboxPlayground.tsx`
2. **Pages & Routes**:
   - `/src/app/docs/playground/page.tsx`
   - `/src/app/api/sandbox/route.ts`
3. **Dependencies**:
   - `@monaco-editor/react`
   - `monaco-editor`
   - `@vercel/sandbox`
   - `ms`
   - `@types/ms`
4. **Navigation**:
   - Removed "Interactive Playground" link from sidebar
   - Removed playground breadcrumb mapping

### Rationale

The playground feature added unnecessary complexity and dependencies to the documentation site. Users can test tryError by installing it directly in their projects, making an interactive playground redundant.

All Week 3 goals have been completed ahead of schedule!
