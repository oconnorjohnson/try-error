   - ✅ Added error filtering support
   - ✅ Added custom retry strategies (linear/exponential backoff)
   - ✅ Added Error Context Provider for child component access
   - ✅ Added ARIA labels for accessibility

2. **useTry.ts**

   - ✅ Fixed race condition by checking executionId before await
   - ✅ Fixed memory leak on fast unmount with proper cleanup
   - ✅ Fixed deps array handling with useMemo
   - ✅ Improved AbortController cleanup with Set tracking
   - ✅ Added cache support for request deduplication
   - ✅ Added debounce support
   - ✅ Added Suspense support
   - ✅ Added request deduplication with pending requests map

3. **useTryCallback.ts**

   - ✅ Fixed type safety with proper generic constraints
   - ✅ Fixed unsafe FormData creation
   - ✅ Added memoization for transform functions
   - ✅ Added loading state support with `useTryCallbackWithState`
   - ✅ Added proper dependency handling

4. **useTryMutation.ts**

   - ✅ Fixed component unmount check
   - ✅ Fixed error type confusion
   - ✅ Made mutate return the promise
   - ✅ Added mutation queue support
   - ✅ Added optimistic update support with rollback
   - ✅ Improved error handling consistency

5. **useTryState.ts**

   - ✅ Fixed stale closure with useRef
   - ✅ Added proper TryError creation with createError
   - ✅ Added async state updates support
   - ✅ Added state validation hook
   - ✅ Added persisted state hook with localStorage
   - ✅ Improved type compatibility

6. **types/index.ts**

   - ✅ Added discriminated unions for error types
   - ✅ Added type predicates for all error types
   - ✅ Added utility types for React usage
   - ✅ Added component prop types
   - ✅ Added helper types for async operations
   - ✅ Fixed incomplete type exports

7. **index.ts**

   - ✅ Fixed missing type exports
   - ✅ Added React version check
   - ✅ Added core version compatibility check
   - ✅ Fixed circular import risks
   - ✅ Improved tree-shaking with selective exports

8. **test-setup.ts & test-utils.tsx**

   - ✅ Added comprehensive test setup
   - ✅ Created test utilities for error boundary testing
   - ✅ Added mock error factories
   - ✅ Added MockAbortController for testing
   - ✅ Added test helpers for common scenarios

9. **ErrorContext.tsx** (New)
   - ✅ Created Error Context Provider
   - ✅ Added hooks for accessing error state from children
   - ✅ Integrated with TryErrorBoundary

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Used WeakMap for error deduplication to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented proper AbortController cleanup with Set tracking
- Added request caching and deduplication at the hook level
- Made all async operations properly cancellable
- Added comprehensive type safety with discriminated unions
- Focused on developer experience with better error messages and types

**Performance Improvements:**

- Memoized transform functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
- Implemented efficient cleanup for AbortControllers
- Added caching support with configurable TTL
- Optimized state updates with batching where possible

**Next Steps:**

- Add comprehensive tests for all new features
- Add examples demonstrating new capabilities
- Update documentation with new APIs
- Consider adding React DevTools integration
- Add performance benchmarks
