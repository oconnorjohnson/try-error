### Previous Entries

# Try-Error Development Memory

## Project Overview

Try-Error is a TypeScript error handling library designed for zero-overhead, type-safe error handling. It provides a functional approach to error handling without exceptions, similar to Go's error handling pattern but with better ergonomics for TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Key Decisions & Progress

### Core Library

- Implemented zero-overhead error handling with discriminated unions
- Created comprehensive error types and factories
- Added source location tracking for better debugging
- Achieved performance targets (< 0.1ms overhead)

### React Package Progress (Latest)

#### Completed Improvements âœ…

1. **Async Error Boundary**:

   - Added support for catching unhandled promise rejections
   - Implemented global error handlers for async operations
   - Created hooks: `useAsyncError()`, `useAsyncErrorHandler()`
   - Added `AsyncErrorBoundary` component

2. **Type Predicates**:

   - Enhanced all type predicates to use `isTryError` from core
   - Added utility predicates: `isReactError`, `hasFieldErrors`, `isRetryableError`
   - Added helper functions: `getComponentName`, `getFieldErrors`, `isErrorFromComponent`
   - Added state type guards: `isTryState`, `isRetryableTryState`, `isFormTryState`

3. **Telemetry Integration**:

   - Created comprehensive telemetry system with provider pattern
   - Implemented Sentry provider with full error context support
   - Created console provider for development debugging
   - Added hooks: `useTelemetry()`, `withTelemetry()` HOC
   - Support for breadcrumbs, user context, and custom events

4. **Performance Fixes**:

   - Fixed race conditions in `useTry` hook
   - Implemented proper cleanup for AbortControllers
   - Batched state updates to reduce re-renders
   - Added checks to prevent state updates after unmount
   - Fixed `useStateWithError` to properly handle functional updates

5. **Optimistic Updates for Mutations**:
   - Enhanced `useTryMutation` with comprehensive optimistic update support
   - Added support for optimistic data as value or function
   - Implemented automatic rollback on error with custom rollback callbacks
   - Added retry functionality with customizable retry logic and exponential backoff
   - Implemented mutation result caching with configurable cache time
   - Enhanced callbacks to receive variables for better context
   - Added `setData` method for manual data updates with functional update support
   - Added `invalidate` method for cache invalidation
   - Added `isIdle` state and `failureCount` tracking
   - Created comprehensive test suite for optimistic updates

#### Remaining High-Priority Items ðŸš§

1. **Error Recovery Strategies**: Need patterns beyond simple retry
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Add support for optimistic UI updates
3. **Framework Support**: Next.js, Remix, React Native, SSR
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
5. **Development Experience**: Better error messages, examples, devtools

## Technical Context

### Performance Considerations

- React hooks use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for memoization
- State updates are batched where possible
- AbortController cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Execution ID pattern prevents race conditions

### Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive unit tests for all hooks and components
- Manual event dispatching for async error boundary tests (jsdom limitation)
- Mock providers for telemetry testing
- Act warnings addressed with proper async handling

### API Design Principles

1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box, configuration is optional
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work immediately, advanced features opt-in
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions
4. **Framework Agnostic**: Core library has no dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Implement error recovery strategies (retry with backoff, circuit breaker)
2. Add optimistic update support to mutation hooks
3. Create framework-specific integrations
4. Improve accessibility features
5. Build development tools and better documentation

## Optimization and Extensibility Implementation

We've successfully implemented major performance optimizations and extensibility features:

### Performance Optimizations Completed:

1. **Object Pooling** (`src/pool.ts`):

   - ErrorPool class with pre-allocation and reuse
   - Global pool management with statistics
   - Configurable pool size and enable/disable
   - Integrated into createError with config flag

2. **Lazy Evaluation** (`src/lazy.ts`):
   - createLazyError for on-demand property computation
   - Lazy getters for expensive operations (stack traces, source location)
   - Debug proxy for monitoring property access
   - Integrated into createError with lazyStackTrace config

### Extensibility Features Completed:

1. **Middleware System** (`src/middleware.ts`):

   - MiddlewarePipeline for composing error handlers
   - Common middleware: logging, retry, transform, circuit breaker, rate limiting
   - Global middleware registry
   - Composable and filterable middleware

2. **Plugin System** (`src/plugins.ts`):
   - Complete plugin architecture with lifecycle hooks
   - Plugin dependencies and ordering
   - Capability system: config, middleware, error types, utilities
   - Example Sentry plugin implementation
   - Global plugin manager

### Key Design Decisions:

- Object pooling uses mutable error objects internally but presents immutable interface
- Lazy evaluation uses Object.defineProperty for transparent property access
- Middleware follows Express-style next() pattern
- Plugins can extend all aspects of try-error without modifying core

### Integration Points:

- Performance features controlled via config.performance options
- Middleware can be applied globally or per-operation
- Plugins integrate seamlessly with existing error flow
- All features are tree-shakeable when not used

These implementations significantly enhance try-error's performance in high-throughput scenarios and make it extensible for any use case.
