# Try-Error Development Memory

## Core Philosophy

- Zero-overhead error handling for TypeScript
- Progressive enhancement (Stage 0 → 1 → 2 → 3)
- Type-safe, ergonomic API
- Tree-shakeable, minimal bundle size

## Key Decisions

### Architecture

- Result<T, E> pattern (not Either monad)
- Symbol branding for type guards
- Separate sync/async APIs
- No throwing by default

### Performance Targets

- <50% overhead vs try-catch
- Zero dependencies
- Tree-shakeable exports
- Minimal memory allocation

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Features

- ✅ Core types (TryResult, TryError)
- ✅ Basic sync/async error handling
- ✅ Error creation with source location
- ✅ Configuration system

## Context for Next Session

The codebase has been significantly improved based on the comprehensive analysis in improvements.md. Most bugs and inefficiencies have been fixed, and many missing features have been added. The main remaining work is fixing test failures and implementing the more advanced features like object pooling, async stack traces, and monitoring integrations.
