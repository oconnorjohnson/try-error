# Try-Error React Package Analysis: Bugs, Inefficiencies, and Missing Features

## 1. packages/react/src/components/TryErrorBoundary.tsx

### Bugs

- [ ] **Memory Leak with Timeout**: `retryTimeoutId` uses `number` type but `setTimeout` returns `NodeJS.Timeout` in Node and `number` in browser - type mismatch
- [ ] **Unsafe Console Access**: Direct `console` usage without checking if it exists could fail in some environments
- [ ] **Missing Error Type Check**: In `getDerivedStateFromError`, doesn't check if the error is already a TryError before processing
- [ ] **Component Stack Lost**: When converting Error to TryError, the original error's component stack might be lost

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Redundant Error Conversion**: Converts errors in both `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`
- [ ] **Inefficient Error Logging**: Creates new console groups even when not needed
- [ ] **No Error Deduplication**: Same error could be logged multiple times

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Error Recovery Strategies**: No built-in recovery patterns beyond simple retry
- [ ] **No Error Filtering**: Can't filter which errors to catch
- [ ] **No Async Error Boundary**: Doesn't handle Promise rejections
- [ ] **No Error Context Provider**: No way to access error state from child components
- [ ] **No Telemetry Integration**: No built-in support for error tracking services
- [ ] **No Custom Retry Strategies**: Only simple retry count, no exponential backoff

## 2. packages/react/src/hooks/useTry.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Race Condition**: `executionIdRef` check happens after await, component could unmount during async operation
- [ ] **Memory Leak on Fast Unmount**: If component unmounts immediately, execute could still be running
- [ ] **Deps Array Handling**: The eslint-disable comment indicates incorrect dependency handling
- [ ] **AbortController Not Cleaned**: Old abort controllers aren't garbage collected properly

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **State Updates**: Multiple setState calls could be batched
- [ ] **Unnecessary Re-renders**: State updates even when values haven't changed
- [ ] **Signal Creation**: Creates new AbortSignal for every execution even if not needed

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Suspense Support**: Doesn't integrate with React Suspense
- [ ] **No Optimistic Updates**: No built-in support for optimistic UI updates
- [ ] **No Cache**: Results aren't cached between executions
- [ ] **No Debounce/Throttle**: No built-in request debouncing
- [ ] **No Request Deduplication**: Multiple components could make same request

## 3. packages/react/src/hooks/useTryCallback.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Type Safety Issue**: Generic constraints are too loose, allowing any error type
- [ ] **Missing Dependency**: `deps` array doesn't properly type-check callback dependencies
- [ ] **FormData Creation**: Uses `(globalThis as any).FormData` which could fail

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Callback Recreation**: Callbacks recreated on every render even if dependencies haven't changed
- [ ] **No Memoization**: Transform functions aren't memoized

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Loading State**: Callbacks don't provide loading state
- [ ] **No Cancellation**: No way to cancel in-flight callback executions
- [ ] **No Queue Management**: Can't queue or debounce callback executions
- [ ] **No Progress Tracking**: No support for progress updates in long operations

## 4. packages/react/src/hooks/useTryMutation.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Component Unmount Check**: Creates error after component unmounts, violating React rules
- [ ] **Error Type Confusion**: Mixes abort errors with regular errors inconsistently
- [ ] **Promise Not Returned**: `mutate` doesn't return the promise, making it hard to chain

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Duplicate Error Handling**: Similar error handling logic repeated multiple times
- [ ] **State Updates**: Multiple setState calls that could be batched

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Mutation Queue**: Can't queue multiple mutations
- [ ] **No Optimistic Updates**: No built-in optimistic update support
- [ ] **No Rollback**: No automatic rollback on error
- [ ] **No Persistence**: Mutations aren't persisted across page reloads

## 5. packages/react/src/hooks/useTryState.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Stale Closure**: The `state` variable in `setTryState` could be stale
- [ ] **Missing TRY_ERROR_BRAND**: Error object in `useStateWithError` doesn't have the brand symbol
- [ ] **Type Incompatibility**: Created error doesn't match TryError interface completely

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Unnecessary Callbacks**: `clearError` recreated on every render
- [ ] **No Batching**: State and error updates happen separately

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Async State Updates**: Doesn't support async state setters
- [ ] **No State History**: No undo/redo functionality
- [ ] **No State Persistence**: No localStorage integration
- [ ] **No State Validation**: No schema validation for state updates

## 6. packages/react/src/types/index.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Incomplete Type Exports**: Some types are defined but not exported
- [ ] **Type Conflicts**: Some types conflict with core try-error types

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Duplicate Type Definitions**: Some types duplicate core library types
- [ ] **Overly Complex Generics**: Some generic constraints are unnecessarily complex

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Discriminated Unions**: Error types aren't properly discriminated
- [ ] **No Type Predicates**: Missing type guard functions for React-specific types
- [ ] **No Utility Types**: Missing common utility types for React usage
- [ ] **No Component Types**: No pre-defined component prop types for common patterns

## 7. packages/react/src/index.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Missing Type Exports**: Not all types from types/index.ts are exported
- [ ] **Circular Import Risk**: Re-exporting from try-error could cause circular dependencies

### Inefficiencies

- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Exports everything, preventing tree-shaking
- [ ] **No Code Splitting**: All hooks loaded even if only one is used

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Version Check**: No way to verify try-error core version compatibility
- [ ] **No React Version Check**: Doesn't verify React version compatibility
- [ ] **No Development Warnings**: No development-only warnings for common mistakes

## 8. packages/react/src/test-setup.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Incomplete Setup**: Only imports jest-dom, missing other necessary test utilities

### Missing Features

- [ ] **No Test Utilities**: No test helpers for testing components using try-error
- [ ] **No Mock Factories**: No factory functions for creating test errors
- [ ] **No Test Hooks**: No renderHook utilities specific to try-error hooks

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Issues

1. [ ] **No React.memo Usage**: Components aren't memoized
2. [ ] **No useMemo/useCallback Optimization**: Missing optimization in critical paths
3. [ ] **No Concurrent Features**: Doesn't use React 18 concurrent features
4. [ ] **No Code Splitting**: Everything bundled together

### Type Safety Issues

1. [ ] **Weak Generic Constraints**: Many generics accept `any`
2. [ ] **Missing Type Guards**: No runtime type checking for props
3. [ ] **Inconsistent Error Types**: Mix of Error and TryError types

### Testing Concerns

1. [ ] **No Test Utils**: No utilities for testing error boundaries
2. [ ] **No Mock Providers**: No way to mock error context
3. [ ] **No Snapshot Utilities**: No serializers for error snapshots

### Developer Experience

1. [ ] **No DevTools**: No browser extension for debugging
2. [ ] **Poor Error Messages**: Generic error messages that don't help debugging
3. [ ] **No Examples**: Insufficient inline examples
4. [ ] **No Playground**: No interactive examples

### Integration Issues

1. [ ] **No Next.js Support**: No specific Next.js integration
2. [ ] **No Remix Support**: No Remix-specific utilities
3. [ ] **No React Native Support**: Won't work in React Native
4. [ ] **No SSR Support**: Server-side rendering issues

### Accessibility

1. [ ] **No ARIA Labels**: Error boundaries don't have proper ARIA labels
2. [ ] **No Screen Reader Support**: Errors aren't announced to screen readers
3. [ ] **No Keyboard Navigation**: Retry buttons might not be keyboard accessible

### Security Concerns

1. [ ] **XSS Risk**: Error messages rendered without sanitization
2. [ ] **Sensitive Data**: Error context might contain sensitive information
3. [ ] **No CSP Support**: Inline styles might violate Content Security Policy
