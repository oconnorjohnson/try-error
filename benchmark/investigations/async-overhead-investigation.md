# Async Overhead Investigation

## üö® Problem Statement

Our benchmarks show that `tryAsync` has a **184-234% overhead** compared to native async/await, which is significantly higher than our sync overhead of only 1-5%. This is concerning and needs investigation.

## üìä Initial Observations

### Benchmark Results

```
Standard benchmark (index.ts):
- Native async/await: 5.00ms (100k iterations)
- tryAsync: 14.23ms (100k iterations)
- Overhead: +184.41%

Library comparison (compare.ts):
- Native async/await: 5.08ms
- tryAsync: 16.96ms
- Overhead: +233.8%
```

### Context

- Sync operations have only 1-5% overhead
- Error path can even be FASTER than native (-6% to -28%)
- Memory usage is efficient (2.67 bytes per error)
- The async overhead is our biggest performance issue

## ü§î Initial Hypotheses

### H1: Promise Wrapping Overhead

- `tryAsync` wraps the promise in additional error handling
- Each promise resolution goes through extra layers
- Native async/await might have JIT optimizations we're missing

### H2: Error Transformation Cost

- Converting thrown errors to TryErrors in async context
- Possible repeated error creation/transformation

### H3: Async Context Loss

- Loss of V8 optimization due to our wrapper
- Breaking the async/await optimization chain

### H4: Measurement Artifact

- Small absolute times (5ms for 100k) might amplify percentage
- Need to verify with longer-running async operations

## üîç Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Profiling Current Implementation

1. **Examine tryAsync implementation**

   - [ ] Review the current code
   - [ ] Identify all operations in the async path
   - [ ] Count function calls and object allocations

2. **CPU Profiling**

   - [ ] Run with Node.js profiler
   - [ ] Identify hot spots
   - [ ] Compare native vs tryAsync flame graphs

3. **Micro-benchmarks**
   - [ ] Test just promise wrapping
   - [ ] Test error catching in async
   - [ ] Test with different promise complexities

### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis

1. **Other Libraries**

   - [ ] How does neverthrow handle async?
   - [ ] What about fp-ts Task?
   - [ ] Any libraries with better async performance?

2. **V8 Optimizations**
   - [ ] Research V8's async/await optimizations
   - [ ] Check if we're deoptimizing somehow
   - [ ] Test with different Node versions

### Phase 3: Optimization Experiments

1. **Minimal Async Wrapper**

   - [ ] Create bare minimum async wrapper
   - [ ] Measure overhead of each added feature
   - [ ] Find the expensive operations

2. **Alternative Implementations**
   - [ ] Try different promise handling approaches
   - [ ] Test with native Promise methods
   - [ ] Experiment with async generators?
