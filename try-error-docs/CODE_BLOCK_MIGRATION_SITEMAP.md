# Code Block Migration Sitemap & Progress Tracker

## Goal

Replace ALL code blocks across the entire try-error documentation with enhanced syntax highlighting, copy functionality, and package manager selection.

## Migration Pattern

1. Add import: `import { CodeBlock, InstallCommand } from '../../../components/EnhancedCodeBlock';`
2. Replace `<div className="bg-slate-900..."><pre><code>` with `<CodeBlock language="..." title="...">`
3. For install commands, use `<InstallCommand packageName="..." />`
4. Add appropriate language tags (typescript, tsx, json, bash, etc.)
5. Add meaningful titles where helpful

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority** (user-facing, frequently accessed):

   - âœ… `/docs` (main intro) - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/concepts/philosophy` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/concepts/tryresult-vs-exceptions` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/examples/basic` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/api/sync` - COMPLETED

2. **Medium Priority**:

   - âœ… `/docs/concepts/error-types` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/api/async` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/examples/react` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/migration` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/guides/migration` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/react/hooks` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/guides/integration` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/react/components` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/react/types` - COMPLETED
   - âœ… `/docs/advanced/performance` - COMPLETED

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Advanced topics
   - Configuration references

## Code Block Count Estimate

Based on grep search results: **100+ code blocks** across all pages

## Notes

- Use relative imports to avoid path resolution issues
- TypeScript/JavaScript code should use `language="typescript"` or `language="tsx"`
- Installation commands should use `InstallCommand` component
- JSON configs should use `language="json"`
- Shell commands should use `language="bash"`
- Add titles for better UX: "Basic Example", "Advanced Usage", etc.
- Enable line numbers for longer examples with `showLineNumbers={true}`

## Progress Tracking

- Total Pages: ~25 pages
- Completed: 19 pages (76%)
- Remaining: 6 pages (24%)
- Estimated Code Blocks: 100+

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE REACHED!

We're now at 76% completion with 121+ code blocks updated! Nearly all the major high-priority pages are done. The core API references, key concepts, main examples, migration guides, complete React integration, and advanced performance optimization are all enhanced with beautiful syntax highlighting and copy functionality.

## Remaining Work

Only 6 pages remain, mostly reference documentation and advanced topics. The heavy lifting is done!
