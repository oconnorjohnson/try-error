# Try-Error React Package Analysis: Remaining Improvements

## 1. packages/react/src/components/TryErrorBoundary.tsx

### Bugs

- [x] ~~**Memory Leak with Timeout**: `retryTimeoutId` uses `number` type but `setTimeout` returns `NodeJS.Timeout` in Node and `number` in browser - type mismatch~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**Unsafe Console Access**: Direct `console` usage without checking if it exists could fail in some environments~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**Missing Error Type Check**: In `getDerivedStateFromError`, doesn't check if the error is already a TryError before processing~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**Component Stack Lost**: When converting Error to TryError, the original error's component stack might be lost~~ ✅ FIXED

### Inefficiencies

- [x] ~~**Redundant Error Conversion**: Converts errors in both `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**Inefficient Error Logging**: Creates new console groups even when not needed~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**No Error Deduplication**: Same error could be logged multiple times~~ ✅ FIXED

### Missing Features

- [x] ~~**No Error Recovery Strategies**: No built-in recovery patterns beyond simple retry~~ ✅ FIXED - Implemented comprehensive error recovery with circuit breaker, exponential backoff, and bulkhead patterns
- [x] ~~**No Error Filtering**: Can't filter which errors to catch~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**No Async Error Boundary**: Doesn't handle Promise rejections~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**No Error Context Provider**: No way to access error state from child components~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**No Telemetry Integration**: No built-in support for error tracking services~~ ✅ FIXED
- [x] ~~**No Custom Retry Strategies**: Only simple retry count, no exponential backoff~~ ✅ FIXED

## 2. packages/react/src/hooks/useTry.ts

### Bugs

- [x] ~~**AbortController Not Cleaned**: Old abort controllers aren't garbage collected properly~~ ✅ FIXED

### Inefficiencies

- [x] ~~**State Updates**: Multiple setState calls could be batched~~ ✅ FIXED

## 4. packages/react/src/hooks/useTryMutation.ts

### Bugs

- [ ] **Component Unmount Check**: Creates error after component unmounts, violating React rules

- [ ] **No Utility Types**: Missing common utility types for React usage
- [ ] **No Component Types**: No pre-defined component prop types for common patterns

## 7. packages/react/src/index.ts

### Bugs
